Crazy tech world! Product offering is so untransparent and hard to compare. \
Cloudflare rocks but their pricing (logger) looks feasible for Enterprises/Large business a bit short sighted use case\
Fastly looked great (logger much more accessible) but their dev account doesn't allow own domain + TLS which is not super obvious (mentioned in their docs only). Sorry if you offer trial you should clearly state limitations! If you give xx USD I would expect I could spend it how i want
